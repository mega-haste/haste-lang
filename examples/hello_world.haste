# Here is the starting point of our program!!
func main() {
  @println("Hello World");

  # in Haste, you need to add the `;` at the end of the most statements, like variable declarations and expressions.
  # controle flows don't follow the semi colon rule (Just like any C-Like programming language).

  # Now, you may wonder. Why the '@' symbol?
  # It means that the thing you're calling isn't a function, but a macro.
